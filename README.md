This [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-identify-trends-corpora/blob/master/trends-doxa.ipynb) uses the Linked Open Data repository of the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes.

This example is based on the journal *Doxa.

The information regarding this publication has been published as LOD in the BVMC repository, including metadata and text, and is accessible by means of the SPARQL endpoint.
